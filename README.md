# GCSE Binary Game

## Introduction
* Computer Science teaching is gradually moving towards non-computer based classroom learning, with limited school based equipment availability.
* Resulting in the lack of interactivity in the lesson, utilising technology.
* The intention is to supply a mobile quiz solution for learners on a GCSE Computer Science Topic: Binary Manipulation
* The web based application can be accessible via mobile devices or limited mobile device technology accessible to the teacher
* The game element can be utilised as a starter or plenary activity, testing knowledge at the end of the topic delivery
* The game itself will be a full graphical user interface which would benefit with a time-based element to mimic the examination time
* The game would complement working time for the learner to plan their answers, which can also be handed into the teacher, to show workings towards a set of questions

## Strategic Plane
### Purpose
* To provide students with a fun way of learning content at the end of the topic delivery
* To create a graphical user interface to support their learning with is fully accessible via a mobile device
* Media access controls support ipad and iphone size screens with limited left/right scrolling
* Screen reader technology assistance should be compatiable with the game play
* Up to 20 exam style questions that complement the following topics: 
    + Binary Addition
    + Binary Subtraction
    + Ones Complement
    + Twos Complement
    + Bitwise Manipulation
    + Boolean Simplication
    + Karnaugh Map
 
* A time based element to respond to the exam style question
* An appropriate output that supports the learner in being able to navigate solutions to the question and further revision links to support their learning

### User Stories
* As a user i want an easily accessible game that supports my learning of binary manipulation and simplication
* As a user i want to be able to answer a series of questions and know how successful during my learning journey
* As a user i want to see exam style questions that compliment actual exam style questions
* As a user i want to be able to be able to play the game inside and outside a classroom environment via a mobile device
* As a user i would like the game to accessible via a touchscreen, to reduce keyboard functionality
* As a user i would like to be able to have support with assistive technology to read questions and potential answers
* As a user i would like to minimise the amount of navigation to limited buttons

## Scope Plane

### Planned Features
* Although the target device is predominantly for mobile devices, it should also be accessible on a computer screen (max-width: 2000px)
* All navigational elements within the game should be clear for users to click and access features within the game
* The user interface should be clear with high contrast between the background and foreground elements
* The interface should compliment touchscreen technology (core audience) as well as keyboard functionality (peripheral audience)
* An appropriate time frame for each question (considering 2 minutes per question, forwarding to next question with no interaction)
* Utilise DOM elements to personalise the game to the user, considering naming element and score feature with encouraging messages
* To provide working solutions for the user to see exemplar answers to each question, accessible at the end of the quiz
* A top score feature that motivates the learner to engage a repeat of the revision questions to improve their score
* Simple html elements that limits the number of html pages within the design
* Storing questions and high scores within an external file (for easy recall each time the game is played and recall previous scores)
* Using multiple choice questions, 4 options per question (as per research 4 options seems a popular choice)
