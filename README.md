# GCSE Binary Game

## Introduction
<ul>
<li>Computer Science teaching is gradually moving towards non-computer based classroom learning, with limited school based equipment availability.</li>
<li>Resulting in the lack of interactivity in the lesson, utilising technology.</li>
<li>The intention is to supply a mobile quiz solution for learners on a GCSE Computer Science Topic: Binary Manipulation</li>
<li>The web based application can be accessible via mobile devices or limited mobile device technology accessible to the teacher</li>
<li>The game element can be utilised as a starter or plenary activity, testing knowledge at the end of the topic delivery</li>
<li>The game itself will be a full graphical user interface which would benefit with a time-based element to mimic the examination time</li>
<li>The game would complement working time for the learner to plan their answers, which can also be handed into the teacher, to show workings towards a set of questions</li>
</ul>

## Strategic Plane
### Purpose
<ul>
<li>To provide students with a fun way of learning content at the end of the topic delivery</li>
<li>To create a graphical user interface to support their learning with is fully accessible via a mobile device</li>
<li>Media access controls support ipad and iphone size screens with limited left/right scrolling</li>
<li>Screen reader technology assistance should be compatiable with the game play</li>
<li>Up to 20 exam style questions that complement the following topics: </li>
<ul>
    <li>Binary Addition</li>
    <li>Binary Subtraction</li>
    <li>Ones Complement</li>
    <li>Twos Complement</li>
    <li>Bitwise Manipulation</li>
    <li>Boolean Simplication</li>
    <li>Karnaugh Map</li>
</ul> 
<li>A time based element to respond to the exam style question</li>
<li>An appropriate output that supports the learner in being able to navigate solutions to the question and further revision links to support their learning</li>
</ul>

### User Stories
<ul>
<li>As a user i want an easily accessible game that supports my learning of binary manipulation and simplication</li>
<li>As a user i want to be able to answer a series of questions and know how successful during my learning journey</li>
<li>As a user i want to see exam style questions that compliment actual exam style questions</li>
<li>As a user i want to be able to be able to play the game inside and outside a classroom environment via a mobile device</li>
<li>As a user i would like the game to accessible via a touchscreen, to reduce keyboard functionality</li>
<li>As a user i would like to be able to have support with assistive technology to read questions and potential answers</li>
<li>As a user i would like to minimise the amount of navigation to limited buttons</li>
</ul>
